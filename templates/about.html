	<p><h1>Story</h1>
		This project was born out of spending an inordinate amount of time on the Minnesota Secretary of States website looking at election results. If this is a thing you've done, you know how tedious it can be to navigate, not only between different races, but also between different years. 
		<br><br>
		The goal for this site is to provide a simple interface for quickly navigating between results in different years and races. As well as to provide a common sense and consistent url structure for easily locating election data.</p>
		<p>
		<h3>Explaination of URL Structure</h3><br>
		The follwing table illustrates the url paths available. Values inside [] brackets indicates a range to choose from.
		</p>
		<table><tr><th>Base</th><th>Type</th><th>Year</th><th>Office</th><th>District</th></tr>
			<tr><td rowspan="12">http://elections.left.mn/</td><td rowspan="6">general/</td><td rowspan="12">[2012-2000]/</td><td>president</td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td>ussenator1</td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td>ussenator2</td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td>governor</td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td>secretaryofstate</td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td>attorneygeneral</td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td rowspan="6">primary/</td><td>auditor</td><td></td></tr>

			<tr><td>house/</td><td>[1A-67B]</td></tr>

		<p>As an example, the path to the results of the 2012 8th district US House race would be:<br><br>
			<a style="margin-left:25px;" href="http://elections.left.mn/general/2012/ushouse/8" target="_blank">http://elections.left.mn/general/2012/ushouse/8</a>
		</p>
	<p><h1>Data</h1>
